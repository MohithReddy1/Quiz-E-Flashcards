# Quiz-E-Flashcards

In this E-Flashcards program I have used three main classes : 
1. QuizCardBuilder : It is a simple authoring tool for creating and saving set of e-flashcards. 
2. QuizCardPlayer : It is a playback engine that can load a flashcard set and play it for the user. 
3. QuizCard : It is a simple class representing card data.
